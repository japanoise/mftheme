# Motherfucking Theme

A minimalist theme for hugo, inspired by the motherfucking websites.

Ripped from the css on my main site.

## Features

- Minimalist
- Supports tags and categories
- No JavaScript
- Produces very small pages (some on my blog are under 1k)
- Works the same on mobile and desktop
- Link previews for social media (confirmed to work on discord, might also work
  elsewhere, but has not been tested)

## Customization

You are strongly encouraged to customise this theme.

You can put some stuff in the `[params]` section of your config.toml to make the
social media previews more interesting:

- Set `logo` to a path/url to an image to show a logo in the image preview.
- Set `twitter` to an @username to tell Twitter who to credit with the article.
